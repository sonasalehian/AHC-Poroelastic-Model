# AHC-Poroelastic-Model
The AHC-Poroelastic-Model is a practical software designed for simulating AHC aquifer systems. The model incorporates Biot equations to represent poroelastic behavior, and these equations are effectively solved using the finite element method (FEM) within the Fenicsx framework.
